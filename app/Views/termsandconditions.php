                        <p>Thank you for choosing Lab-Ready. Given the custom nature of our products, please review the following terms regarding refunds and cancellations:</p>
                        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Before Production:</strong> You may cancel your order without any charge at any time before production has begun. Please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:info@lab-ready.net">info@lab-ready.net</a> or 662-910-9173 if you wish to cancel your order.</p>
                        <p><strong>After Production Has Begun:</strong> Once production has started, we cannot accept cancellations as each product is custom-made to your specifications. As such, we encourage you to double-check your order before confirmation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Returns</h3>
                        <p>Due to the personalized and custom nature of our products, we generally do not accept returns.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Refunds</h3>
                        <p><strong>Defective Products:</strong> If your product is defective or does not meet the specifications of your order, please contact us within 7 days of receiving the product. We will assess these issues on a case-by-case basis and determine the appropriate resolution, which may include a repair, replacement, or refund.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Since our products are custom-made, all orders that have entered production are non-refundable except in the case of defects or manufacturing errors.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Shipping Costs for Returns</h3>
                        <p>If a return or exchange is approved due to a defect or error on our part, we will cover the shipping costs. In all other scenarios, shipping costs for returning an item are the responsibility of the customer and are non-refundable.</p>
